# ExceptionHandling Smart Contract

The `ExceptionHandling` smart contract is a simple example written in Solidity to demonstrate the usage of the `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements for exception handling in Ethereum smart contracts.

## Contract Details

- **License**: UNLICENSED
- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.19

## Contract Description

The `ExceptionHandling` smart contract defines a function `setValue` that showcases the usage of three different exception handling mechanisms:

1. **require**: It is used to check a condition and ensure that a specific requirement is met. If the condition is not satisfied, the transaction will revert with a custom error message.

2. **assert**: This statement is used for internal consistency checks. It ensures that a specific condition is true and will halt the contract execution if the condition fails.

3. **revert**: If certain exceptional circumstances or errors occur, the `revert` statement is used to revert the transaction with a custom error message.

## Functionality

- The `setValue` function takes a single argument, `_newValue`, of type `uint256`.
- It checks whether `_newValue` is greater than 0 using the `require` statement. If the condition is not met, it reverts with the error message "Value must be greater than 0."
- It checks whether `_newValue` is not equal to 999 using the `assert` statement. If this condition fails, it halts the contract execution.
- If both `require` and `assert` conditions are met, the `value` state variable is updated with the provided `_newValue`.
- If `_newValue` is equal to 42, it uses the `revert` statement to revert the transaction with the custom error message "The answer to life, the universe, and everything."
